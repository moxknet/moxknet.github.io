title: Validando a dor do paciente

> **Addressing these issues together, rather than waiting to address emotional issues after somatic causes of pain have been ruled out, improves compliance in part because it assures patients that a psychological evaluation does not mean that the physician is questioning the validity of their complaint**. Even when a somatic cause for a patientâ€™s pain can be found, it is still wise to look for other factors. For example, a cancer patient with painful bony metastases may have additional pain due to nerve damage and may also be depressed.
