title: Que danado é amiloidose?

> Amyloidosis is a generic term that refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of subunits of a variety of normal serum proteins. These fibrils have a predominantly antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration (noted on x-ray diffraction) and can be identified on biopsy specimens both by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy and by their ability to bind Congo red (leading to green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavin T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence).

> More than 30 distinct low molecular weight proteins are recognized to form amyloid fibrils. The four most common causes of systemic amyloid deposition are:

> Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis (historically referred to as primary amyloidosis) in which the fibrils are composed of fragments of monoclonal light chains. Affected patients may have amyloidosis alone or in association with other plasma cell dyscrasias (multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia). All forms of systemic amyloidosis in which the fibrils are derived from monoclonal light chains, regardless of the nature of the underlying plasma cell disorder (eg, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, multiple myeloma, or Waldenström macroglobulinemia) are considered AL amyloidosis.
